    "### Contexto del Problema\n",
    "El Banco de Comisiones Infinitas (BCI), liderado por Ignacio Yacurro, busca desarrollar un modelo de riesgo crediticio para predecir la probabilidad de mora de los clientes. El objetivo es maximizar los ingresos por intereses mientras se minimizan las pérdidas por préstamos incobrables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descripción del Problema\n",
    "- **Qué se busca predecir**: La probabilidad de morosidad de los clientes.\n",
    "- **Datos**: Incluyen información relevante sobre clientes y su historial financiero.\n",
    "- **Métrica Seleccionada**: Se utilizará **AUC-PR** \n",
    "- **Modelos y Transformaciones**: Se probaron modelos como \n",
    "- **Resultados**: Se analizará si el modelo cumple con los objetivos del concurso y cómo se compara con otros equipos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justificación de la Métrica Seleccionada Se ha utilizado AUC-PR como métrica de evaluación, ya que se enfoca en medir la calidad de las predicciones para la clase positiva (clientes morosos) en problemas de clasificación desbalanceados. Dado que el objetivo es priorizar la identificación precisa de clientes con alto riesgo, esta métrica resulta más adecuada que otras como ROC-AUC, aunque pudiese ser beneficioso incorporar alguna como F1 score y la matriz de confusion para identificar las falencias de los modelos, incluso una posible complementariedad\n",

    "Este modelo y enfoque son particularmente efectivos por varias razones técnicas clave:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Elección de LightGBM:\n",
    "- LightGBM es especialmente eficiente para este caso de uso porque utiliza un algoritmo de crecimiento de árbol basado en hojas (leaf-wise), que es más adecuado para datos financieros donde las señales pueden ser sutiles y dispersas\n",
    "- La implementación de GOSS (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling) de LightGBM ayuda a manejar el desbalance inherente en datos de detección de riesgo financiero\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hiperparámetros optimizados:\n",
    "- La búsqueda del learning_rate entre 0.01 y 0.3 permite encontrar un balance entre velocidad de convergencia y estabilidad\n",
    "- El rango de num_leaves (10-100) y max_depth (5-15) está bien calibrado para evitar overfitting mientras mantiene suficiente capacidad de modelado\n",
    "- El feature_fraction y bagging_fraction (0.6-1.0) ayudan a reducir la varianza del modelo y mejorar la generalización\n",
    "- min_data_in_leaf (10-200) previene el overfitting en ramas específicas\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estrategia de optimización:\n",
    "- El uso de Optuna permite una búsqueda eficiente en el espacio de hiperparámetros\n",
    "- La optimización está dirigida específicamente a maximizar AUC-PR, que es más apropiada que AUC-ROC para casos desbalanceados\n",
    "- Early stopping con 50 rondas previene el overfitting mientras permite suficiente tiempo para convergencia\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preprocesamiento y features:\n",
    "- La selección de variables incluye tanto métricas de transacción (tx_count) como indicadores de riesgo (risk_factor)\n",
    "- Se mantienen ratios y diferencias (borrow_repay_diff_eth) que capturan relaciones importantes\n",
    "- La inclusión de promedios y sumas permite al modelo capturar tanto patrones puntuales como acumulativos\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Manejo de datos:\n",
    "- La división train-test (80-20) proporciona suficientes datos para entrenamiento mientras mantiene un conjunto de validación representativo\n",
    "- El uso de early_stopping_rounds previene el overfitting monitoreando el rendimiento en validación\n",
    "- La métrica AUCPR es especialmente relevante para problemas de detección de riesgo donde los eventos positivos son menos frecuentes\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Eficiencia computacional:\n",
    "- El límite de 400 boost_rounds con early stopping balanza la exploración con la eficiencia\n",
    "- El almacenamiento en formato JSON permite fácil despliegue y portabilidad\n",
    "- La estructura del modelo permite interpretabilidad a través de importancia de features\n",
    "\n",
    "Este enfoque combina robustez estadística con practicidad implementacional, haciéndolo particularmente efectivo para problemas de detección de riesgo financiero."
